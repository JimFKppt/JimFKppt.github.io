Dynamic array

## Problem

**The number of insertions**

Assume that the size and capacity of a dynamic array are equal to 2 and 4 respectively, and the scaling factor is 2. After you perform n*n* insertions, the capacity of the array will become 1024. What is the minimum possible value of *n*?

Enter a number:

`511`

**Correct.**

## Hint & Explain

> 1. What was the previous capacity, before it became 1024?
> 2. This previous capacity should be exceeded.
> 3. The array has 2 elements at the beginning, they don't count.
