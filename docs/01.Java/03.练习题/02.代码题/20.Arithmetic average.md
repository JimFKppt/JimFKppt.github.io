## Problem
**Arithmetic average**

Write a program that reads two numbers a*a* and b*b* from the keyboard and calculates and outputs to the console the arithmetic average of all numbers from the interval [a; b][*a*;*b*], which are divisible by 33.

In the example below, the arithmetic average is calculated for the numbers on the interval [-5; 12][−5;12]. On this interval, there are 66 numbers divisible by 33, namely: -3, 0, 3, 6, 9, 12−3,0,3,6,9,12. Their arithmetic average equals 4.54.5.

The program input contains intervals, which always contain at least one number, which is divisible by 33.

Remember that the int type cannot contain fractions. Use a double variable to store the precise result of the division.

## Solution
### My solution
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        // start coding here
        int numberA = scanner.nextInt();
        int numberB = scanner.nextInt();
        int counter = 0;
        double sum = 0.0;

        for (int i = numberA; i <= numberB; i++) {
            if (i % 3 == 0) {
                counter++;
                sum += i;
            }
        }

        System.out.println(sum / counter);
    }
}
```
### Other solution 1
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

        double result = IntStream.rangeClosed(in.nextInt(), in.nextInt())
                                 .filter(value -> value % 3 == 0)
                                 .average()
                                 .orElse(0);

        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```
