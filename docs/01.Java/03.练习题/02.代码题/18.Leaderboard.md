Comparable

## Problem

**Leaderboard**

There is an application to create leaderboards of e-sports competitions. It uses the `Score` class to represent a score of each player. This class has two fields: `player` for the player's name and `totalScore` for that player's total score. To build a leaderboard, the `Score` objects need to be compared. A `Score` object is considered bigger than another `Score` if it's `totalScore` value is bigger. If `totalScore` values of two `Score` objects are the same, such objects must be compared by their `player` values. See the example below.

### Code of problem

```java
import java.util.*;

class Score implements Comparable<Score> {
    private final String player;
    private final int totalScore;

    public Score(String player, int totalScore) {
        this.player = player;
        this.totalScore = totalScore;
    }

    public String getPlayer() {
        return player;
    }

    public int getTotalScore() {
        return totalScore;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return player + '=' + totalScore;
    }

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Score score) {
        // your code here
    }
}

// do not change the code below
class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        List<Score> scores = new ArrayList<>();
        while (sc.hasNextLine()) {
            String[] input = sc.nextLine().split(" ");
            Score score = new Score(input[0], Integer.parseInt(input[1]));
            scores.add(score);
        }

        Collections.sort(scores);
        System.out.println(scores);
    }
}
```

## Hint & Explain
> compare both fields (score then player)

## Solution
### My solution

```java
// your code here
if (getTotalScore() > score.getTotalScore()) return 1;
else if (getTotalScore() < score.getTotalScore()) return -1;
else {
    return getPlayer().compareTo(score.getPlayer());
}
```

> BAD!

### Other solution 1

```java
// your code here
int result = Integer.compare(totalScore, score.totalScore);
return result == 0 ? player.compareTo(score.player) : result;
```
### Other solution 2
```java
// your code here
if (totalScore == score.totalScore) {
    return player.compareTo(score.player);
} else {
    return Integer.compare(totalScore, score.totalScore);
}
```
