Why did I choose Wuhan Polytechnic?

Oh, so easy question. I used to be a secondary vocational student. Because I didn't try my best, I didn't get into undergrad, and also didn't get into Wuhan Software And Engineering Polytechnic. So Wuhan Polytechnic probably is my best choice.

This matter gave me a lesson, it tells me: "Look, this is you didn't try your best of the outcome!". Well, since I'm already into Wuhan Polytechnic, take things as they come. 

Let's get back to the topic. Why did I choose Wuhan Polytechnic? 

This question is already said in the previous, but it is not the best answer. Another reason is my major, yeah, this is a point. 

I think these words amount are enough:)
