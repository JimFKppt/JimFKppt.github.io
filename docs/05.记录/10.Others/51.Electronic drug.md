**Electronic drug?**

Now, smartphones are widespread around the world. Nearly everybody has a smartphone. That's not odd, because the world is always evolving. That's good. But, you should know the short video exploded. Since the short video appears, everything seems to have changed. Even many elderly and children are affected. Much less young people. Though a single short video is indeed very short. But, when they gather together. That's not short at all.

If you think this article title is stubborn, you probably misread it. Don't forget the end of the title has "?". I'm not a Riddler. I mean not all smartphones are electronic drugs, depends on the master how to use them. So, the point is we must suitably use smartphones. Otherwise, they are electronic drugs.
