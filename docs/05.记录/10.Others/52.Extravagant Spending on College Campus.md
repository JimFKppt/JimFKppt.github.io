## Extravagant Spending on College Campus

College students are living the dream. They are in an environment that allows them to spend money freely and they are not held accountable for their spending. This is a result of the weak economy and the fact that college students have access to credit cards.

Another reason is the culture on campus. Many colleges have a culture of consumption where students are encouraged to spend money on things like alcohol, food, and entertainment. This attitude can lead students to spend more than they should.

It is important for college students to understand the importance of spending frugally and saving money. This will help them to be prepared for the realities of life after college.

College students need to spend wisely and save as much as possible. This will allow them to be prepared for the realities of life after college.
